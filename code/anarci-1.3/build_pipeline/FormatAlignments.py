"""
Program to reformat the v and j alignments for each species into a single alignment
with combinations of the two genes.

v genes will be trimmed to imgt position 107 ( three after the cysteine at 104 )

j genes are a little bit more complicated as they are not aligned.

We therefore align them with muscle and *do not allow* gaps to open. Use a high gapopen
penalty.

-8 seems to be the first integer to work. Set it to -10.
muscle -in js.fasta -gapopen -10

We have a reference sequence in the alignment for which the numbering is known. Therefore
make the right hand most column imgt 128. Any further are trimmed.

Once aligned, all residue before imgt 116 are ignored (101 in Chothia heavy).
All before are changed to gaps. The rationale is the alignment in this region is
not structurally valid anyway. Want the columns because of the potential imgt states. 

HMMER needs a single alignment to build a HMM. We therefore make putative germline sequences
by combining all the v sequences with all the j sequences. (Each v sequence appears n(j) times).

These are chucked into curated alignments and hmmbuild used to create the HMMs.
